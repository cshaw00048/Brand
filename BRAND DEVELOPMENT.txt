BRAND DEVELOPMENT

I am a Front-end Web Developer with an IT background to looking to build a more efficient user experience on the web.  I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from Vanderbilt University Bootcamp.  I have developed new skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, MongoDB, Firebase, SQL, and Express.  I am a great problem solver passionate about web design and maintenance.  In a recent project I applied aspects of Passport OAUTH for Google and Facebook and Axios.  I worked on a team of four to build an English as a Second Language website complete with quizzes and resources for learning.  I canâ€™t wait to use my skills as part of a team to serve a company and its customers on the web.
